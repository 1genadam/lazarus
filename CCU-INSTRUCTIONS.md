# CCU Instructions: Chat System Diagnostic

## üéØ Mission: Diagnose Chat System Issues

The chat system on the Lazarus Home Remodeling website is not working. We need to run diagnostics to identify the problem.

## üñ•Ô∏è CCU System Access

Your Claude Computer Use system is configured and ready:
- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8070
- **Container Status**: ‚úÖ Active (ID: a7d990b3a65d)
- **FTP Server**: ‚úÖ Configured (localhost:21)

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions  

### Step 1: Navigate to the Diagnostic Tool
1. Go to the project folder: `/Users/robertsher/Projects/lazarus/`
2. Open the file `chat-diagnostic.html` in a web browser
3. This will load the diagnostic tool

### Step 2: Test Each Problem Page
**Run the diagnostic on each of these pages where chat is NOT working:**
- https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/ (main page)
- https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/about.html
- https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/services.html  
- https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/contact.html
- https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/gallery.html
- https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/blog.html

### Step 3: Run Diagnostic Process
For EACH page:
1. Navigate to the page in browser
2. Open the diagnostic tool (`chat-diagnostic.html`) in a new tab
3. Click "üöÄ Run Full Diagnostic" 
4. Wait for results to complete (about 5-10 seconds)
5. Click "üíæ Download Report File"
6. Save file as: `chat-diagnostic-[PAGE-NAME]-[DATE].txt`
   - Example: `chat-diagnostic-about-2025-07-23.txt`

### Step 4: Save Reports
Save all diagnostic files to:
- **Primary location**: Desktop folder named `lazarus-chat-reports`
- **FTP Upload location**: Upload to CCU via FTP for developer analysis
  
### Step 5: Upload to CCU FTP Server
Use your configured FTP setup to upload reports:
```bash
# FTP Connection Details (from your CCU setup)
Host: localhost
Port: 21
Username: ftpuser  
Password: ftppass
Directory: /home/ftpuser/ftp
```

**Upload Process:**
1. Open FTP client or use command line: `ftp -n localhost 21`
2. Login: `user ftpuser ftppass`
3. Create directory: `mkdir lazarus-chat-reports`
4. Change to directory: `cd lazarus-chat-reports`
5. Upload all report files: `put chat-diagnostic-*.txt`
6. Upload summary: `put SUMMARY.txt`

**Automated Upload Option:**
Run the provided script for easier upload:
```bash
cd /Users/robertsher/Projects/lazarus/
./upload-to-ccu.sh
```

### Step 6: Generate Summary
Create a summary file called `SUMMARY.txt` with:
```
CHAT SYSTEM DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY
Date: [Current Date]
Total Pages Tested: [Number]

Pages where chat is NOT working:
- [Page 1]: [Main issues found]
- [Page 2]: [Main issues found]
- etc.

Common Issues Found:
- [List recurring problems across pages]

Files Generated:
- chat-diagnostic-index-[date].txt
- chat-diagnostic-about-[date].txt
- etc.
```

## üö® What to Look For

### Chat Button Issues:
- Button not visible
- Button not clickable
- No response when clicked

### JavaScript Errors:
- Missing chat.js script
- Console errors
- Missing DOM elements

### Network Issues:
- Backend connection problems
- API configuration issues
- Resource loading failures

## üì§ Expected Output

You should generate these files:
1. Individual diagnostic reports for each page (6 files)
2. One summary file explaining the problems
3. All files saved to Desktop in `lazarus-chat-reports` folder

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ Diagnostic run on all 6 pages
‚úÖ Individual reports downloaded and saved
‚úÖ Summary file created with main issues identified
‚úÖ All files organized in proper folder
‚úÖ Reports ready for developer analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If diagnostic tool doesn't work:
1. Try opening `chat-diagnostic.html` directly from file system
2. Or use the console diagnostic method (see `console-diagnostic.js`)
3. Copy and paste that script into browser console (F12)

The goal is to get comprehensive data about what's preventing the chat system from working so the developer can fix it quickly.
