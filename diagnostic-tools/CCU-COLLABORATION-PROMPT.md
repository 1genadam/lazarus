## üí° **TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE COLLABORATION**

### **Communication Best Practices:**
- **Be Specific**: Include exact error messages and steps to reproduce
- **Include Context**: Note browser version, page URL, time of testing
- **Provide Evidence**: Screenshots are worth a thousand words
- **Suggest Solutions**: If you see obvious fixes, mention them
- **Stay Organized**: Clear file naming and directory structure

### **Technical Insights to Look For:**
- **Missing JavaScript files**: Look for 404 errors in Network tab
- **DOM structure issues**: Check if required elements exist with correct IDs
- **Event listener problems**: See if click events are properly attached
- **CSS conflicts**: Look for styling issues hiding elements
