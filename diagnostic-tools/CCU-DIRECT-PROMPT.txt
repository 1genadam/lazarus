â€¢ https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/contact.html
â€¢ https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/gallery.html
â€¢ https://lazarushomeremodeling.com/blog.html

FOR EACH PAGE:
1. Navigate to page
2. Look for yellow chat button (bottom-right corner)
3. Try clicking chat button - does widget open?
4. Press F12, check Console tab for errors
5. Test manually: can you type in chat? Does send button work?
6. Take screenshot if you see issues
7. Save notes: "Page [NAME]: Chat button [works/broken], Widget [opens/stuck], Errors: [list any console errors]"

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
